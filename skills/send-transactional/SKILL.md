# Send Transactional

Help the user send or set up transactional emails/SMS — immediate, single-recipient messages triggered by application events.

## Understand the Use Case

Common transactional email types:
- **Password reset**: OTP or magic link
- **Order confirmation**: Receipt with order details
- **Shipping notification**: Tracking info
- **Welcome/verification**: Account activation
- **System alert**: Service status, security notice
- **Invoice/receipt**: Payment confirmation

## Design Approach

### Quick Send (Plain Text)
For a one-off send from Claude over MCP, use `nitro_send_message`:
```
channel: "email"
to: "user@example.com"
subject: "Your order #1234 is confirmed"
body: "Thank you for your order..."
```

### Branded Template
For on-brand transactional emails:
1. Create a template with `nitro_manage_template` via the composition contract
   (`composition_mode: "intent"` → fill the returned `next_call` → persist with
   `composition_mode: "draft"`; see the compose-email skill)
2. For a one-off MCP send, call `nitro_send_message` with `template_id`
3. For application-triggered production sends, wire `POST /v1/my/messages` or `ns.messages.send` using `template_id`

Live sends require an `idempotency_key` — reuse the same stable key on retry to
prevent duplicate delivery.

### Merge Variables
Use the `data` field for personalization:
```
data: { order_id: "1234", customer: { name: "Alice" }, amount: "$49.99" }
```

Reference in templates/body as `{{ data.order_id }}`, `{{ data.amount }}`, or
nested paths like `{{ data.customer.name }}`.

## Key Differences from Marketing Email

| | Marketing | Transactional |
|---|---|---|
| Audience | Lists/segments | Single recipient |
| Requires subscription | Yes | No |
| CAN-SPAM footer | Required | Skipped |
| Unsubscribe link | Required | Not needed |
| Delivery | Campaign workflow | Immediate |
| Tracking | Opens/clicks tracked | Optional |

Do not model transactional sends as MCP flows. Use `nitro_send_message` for one-off MCP sends, normal flow email steps for lifecycle automation, and API/SDK transactional sends for application events.

## For Developers

Help developers integrate transactional emails into their apps:

### API Integration
```
POST https://api.nitrosend.com/v1/my/messages
Authorization: Bearer nskey_live_...
{
  "channel": "email",
  "to": "user@example.com",
  "subject": "Your verification code",
  "body": "Your code is: 123456",
  "data": { "code": "123456" }
}
```

### SDK Integration
```javascript
import { Nitrosend } from '@nitrosend/sdk'
const ns = new Nitrosend('nskey_live_...')
await ns.messages.send({
  channel: 'email',
  to: 'user@example.com',
  subject: 'Your verification code',
  template_id: 42,
  data: { code: '123456' }
})
```

## Dry Run

Always offer to do a dry run first:
`nitro_send_message` or `POST /v1/my/messages` with `dry_run: true` validates without sending.

## Idempotency

For production use, recommend `idempotency_key` to prevent duplicate sends on retries.
